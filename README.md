Investigated the application of sentimenet analysis to serve as a moderator on public forums and social media.

Utilized the roBERTa model developed by Meta, along with PyTorch, SciPy, and NumPy to create a Python program that allows users to enter the text of any tweet, and recieve an analysis of the tweet (probablity of negative, neutral, and positive).
